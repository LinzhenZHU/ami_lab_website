AmI lab aims to co-design end-to-end mobile, wearable, and IoT systems to achieve the following requirements from different layers.  

{% capture col1 %}

**Applications Layers**: Enable critical or novel applications using MWIoT systems, including 
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI); 
- Mobile, Household, and Industrial Robotics; 
- Mobile Health 
- Environmental Sensing; 
- Autonomous Driving and UVA;
- Multimedia for new scenarios, like 6G, Metaverse, etc.

**Data Processing Layers**: Design the sensor computational models for MWIoT systems to make them i). accurate; ii). intelligent; iii). robust; iv) personalized;

**Systems Layers**: Design the MWIoT systems to achieve
- energy efficiency;
- computational efficiency; 
- communication efficiency;
- trustworthiness; and
- privacy preservation.

**Sensing Layers**: Innovate low-cost solutions with minimal or no hardware modifications to maximize the potential of ubiquitous sensors on existing MWIoT systems. Except for traditional sensors like audio and vision, we specifically focus on ubiquitous MWIoT sensors, like radio frequency, ultrasound, electromagnetic, capacitive sensors, biopotential signals, and olfactory sensors, etc.
