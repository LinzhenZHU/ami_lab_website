Hi, I’m Ruyao! My research interests lie in mobile computing, wearable devices, and next-generation IoT systems, with a focus on designing efficient, intelligent, and privacy-preserving mobile systems for future IoT devices. I aim to develop computational models and system architectures that optimize sensor data processing, enhance energy efficiency, and maximize the potential of ubiquitous sensing technologies with minimal hardware modifications.

I am currently a first-year Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan. Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Central South University and worked as a full-time Quantitative Researcher at Mathlab, a quantitative finance startup, for one year.
